## Chapter I: AI Instructions

### Context
During your learning journey, AI can assist with many different tasks. Take the time to explore the various capabilities of AI tools and how they can support your work. However, always approach them with caution and critically assess the results. Whether it's code, documentation, ideas, or technical explanations, you can never be completely sure that your question was well-formed or that the generated content is accurate. Your peers are a valuable resource to help you avoid mistakes and blind spots.

### Main message
* Use AI to reduce repetitive or tedious tasks.
* Develop prompting skills—both coding and non-coding—that will benefit your future career.
* Learn how AI systems work to better anticipate and avoid common risks, biases, and ethical issues.
* Continue building both technical and power skills by working with your peers.
* **Only use AI-generated content that you fully understand and can take responsibility for**.

### Learner rules
* You should take the time to explore AI tools and understand how they work, so you can use them ethically and reduce potential biases.
* You should reflect on your problem **before** prompting; this helps you write clearer, more detailed, and more relevant prompts using accurate vocabulary.
* You should develop the habit of systematically checking, reviewing, questioning, and testing anything generated by AI.
* You should always seek peer review—don't rely solely on your own validation.

### Phase outcomes
* Develop both general-purpose and domain-specific prompting skills.
* Boost your productivity with effective use of AI tools.
* Continue strengthening computational thinking, problem-solving, adaptability, and collaboration.

### Comments and examples
* You'll regularly encounter situations (exams, evaluations, and more) where you must demonstrate real understanding. Be prepared, keep building both your technical and interpersonal skills.
* Explaining your reasoning and debating with peers often reveals gaps in your understanding. Make peer learning a priority.
* AI tools often lack your specific context and tend to provide generic responses. Your peers, who share your environment, can offer more relevant and accurate insights.
* Where AI tends to generate the most likely answer, your peers can provide alternative perspectives and valuable nuance. Rely on them as a quality checkpoint.

#### Good practice
> I ask AI: "How do I test a sorting function?" It gives me a few ideas. I try them out and review the results with a peer. We refine the approach together.

#### Bad practice
> I ask AI to write a whole function, copy-paste it into my project. During peer-evaluation, I can't explain what it does or why. I lose credibility and I fail my project.

#### Good practice
> I use AI to help design a parser. Then I walk through the logic with a peer. We catch two bugs and rewrite it together—better, cleaner, and fully understood.

#### Bad practice
> I let Copilot generate my code for a key part of my project. It compiles, but I can't explain how it handles pipes. During the evaluation, I fail to justify and I fail my project.

## Chapter II: Preamble

First of all, congratulations on reaching this milestone! You are now entering the final project of your Common Core, and yes, it will not be easy.

Transcendence is a group project (**4-5 people**), which is intended to boost your creativity, self-confidence, adaptability to new technologies, and teamwork skills. You'll create a real-world web application as a team that can move in many directions, depending on the modules you choose and the choices you make. Make sure to think things through together as a team before you start.

The project is divided into two parts:
1.  **The mandatory part:** The fixed core of the project to which every team member must contribute.
2.  **A set of modules:** Which you can choose and which count toward the final grade.

> **Warning:** This is a long group project. Poor early choices and lack of team coordination will cost a lot of time. Your project and team management will strongly impact your results. All team members must actively participate and contribute to both the mandatory part and the modules.

### II.1 Team Organization and Project Management
As this is a group project, proper team organization is crucial for success. You must establish clear roles and responsibilities from the start.

#### II.1.1 Required Team Roles
Your team must assign the following roles (one person can have multiple roles if the team has 4 members):

* **Product Owner (PO):** Defines the product vision, prioritizes features, and ensures the project meets user needs.
    * Maintains the product backlog.
    * Makes decisions on features and priorities.
    * Validates completed work.
    * Communicates with stakeholders (evaluators, peers).
* **Project Manager (PM) / Scrum Master:** Facilitates team coordination and removes obstacles.
    * Organizes team meetings and planning sessions.
    * Tracks progress and deadlines.
    * Ensures team communication.
    * Manages risks and blockers.
* **Technical Lead / Architect:** Oversees technical decisions and architecture.
    * Defines technical architecture.
    * Makes technology stack decisions.
    * Ensures code quality and best practices.
    * Reviews critical code changes.
* **Developers (all team members):** Implement features and modules.
    * Write code for assigned features.
    * Participate in code reviews.
    * Test their implementations.
    * Document their work.

> **Team Size Notes:**
> * **4 people:** Some members will have multiple roles (e.g., PM + Developer, PO + Developer).
> * **5 people:** Roles can be more specialized, with dedicated PO, PM, Tech Lead, and 2 Developers.
> * All roles must be clearly documented in your `README.md`.

#### II.1.2 Recommended Project Management Practices
While not mandatory, we strongly recommend implementing some basic project management practices:
* **Regular communication:** Meet regularly (weekly or bi-weekly) to sync on progress and blockers.
* **Task organization:** Use simple tools like GitHub Issues, Trello, or even a shared document to track who does what.
* **Work breakdown:** Divide the project into smaller, manageable tasks.
* **Code reviews:** Try to have at least one other team member review important code changes.
* **Documentation:** Keep notes of important decisions and how things work.
* **Communication channel:** Use Discord, Slack, or similar for quick team communication.

> **Evaluation Note:** During evaluation, the team will be asked to explain:
> * How roles were distributed.
> * How work was organized and divided.
> * How you communicated and coordinated as a team.
> * How each member contributed to the project.
> * **All team members must be able to explain the project and their contributions**.

## Chapter III: Mandatory part

The project content is up to you. Yes, you have to bring your own ideas and decide together what application to build as a team. It's a step forward from what you did previously in the Common Core. You need to think about the project as a whole, not just the features you're going to implement.

### III.1 What are we doing?
First, you will have to create a comprehensive `README.md` file. The detailed requirements for the README are specified in the "README Requirements" section at the end of this document.

**Project Examples:**
* A multiplayer Pong game with tournament system.
* A collaborative platform with real-time features.
* A social network with user interactions.
* An online game (Chess, Tic-Tac-Toe, etc.) with matchmaking.
* A project management application.
* Any other creative web application that meets the requirements.

The key is to create something engaging that demonstrates your technical skills and creativity.

### III.2 General requirements
Building an entire project is complicated, and many things can go wrong. To help you, we will provide a list of general requirements that you must follow. **If you don't follow them, your project will be rejected**.

* The project must be a web application, and requires a **frontend**, **backend**, and a **database**.
* **Git** must be used with clear and meaningful commit messages. The repository must show:
    * Commits from all team members.
    * Clear commit messages describing the changes.
    * Proper work distribution across the team.
* **Deployment** must use a containerization solution (Docker, Podman, or equivalent) and run with a **single command**.
* Your website must be compatible with the latest stable version of Google Chrome.
* **No warnings or errors** should appear in the browser console.
* The project must include accessible **Privacy Policy** and **Terms of Service** pages with relevant content.

> **Critical Note on Privacy Policy/ToS:**
> These pages will be verified during evaluation. They must:
> * Be easily accessible from the application (e.g., footer links).
> * Contain relevant and appropriate content for your project.
> * Not be placeholder or empty pages.
> * **Missing or inadequate Privacy Policy/Terms of Service pages will result in project rejection**.

> **Multi-user Support (Mandatory):**
> Your website must support multiple users simultaneously. This is a core requirement. Users should be able to interact with the application at the same time without conflicts or performance issues. This includes:
> * Multiple users can be logged in and active at the same time.
> * Concurrent actions by different users are handled properly.
> * Real-time updates are reflected across all connected users when applicable.
> * No data corruption or race conditions occur with simultaneous user actions.

### III.3 Technical requirements
* A **frontend** that is clear, responsive, and accessible across all devices.
* Use a **CSS framework** or styling solution of your choice (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, Material-UI, Styled Components, etc.).
* Store credentials (API keys, environment variables, etc.) in a local `.env` file that is ignored by Git, and provide an `.env.example` file.
* The **database** must have a clear schema and well-defined relations.
* Your application must have a basic **user management system**.
    * Users must be able to sign up and log in securely.
    * At minimum: email and password authentication with proper security (hashed passwords, salted, etc.).
    * Additional authentication methods (OAuth, 2FA, etc.) can be implemented via modules.
* All forms and user inputs must be properly validated in both the frontend and backend.
* For the backend, **HTTPS** must be used everywhere.

> **What is a Framework?**
> For this project, a framework is defined as a comprehensive tool that provides a structured architecture, built-in features (routing, state management), and a complete ecosystem.
> * **Frontend frameworks:** React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Next.js.
> * **Backend frameworks:** Express, Fastify, NestJS, Django, Flask, Ruby on Rails.
> * **NOT frameworks:** jQuery, Lodash, Axios.
> * *Note:* React is considered a framework in this context due to its ecosystem and architectural patterns.
